# Implementation
The crawler was implemented by using the webpage.h, the pagedir.h and the bag.h and hashtable.h header files.
It uses the webpage.h and pagedir.h combination to parse and find links from an html page, while using those headers also to fetch html page from a url.

It also creates and saves file using those modules, while keeping account of explored urls and webpages using the
bag and hashtable modules.
